Data Project: Roll Your Own Scientific Data Visualization
Akshay Shinde / shindea@oregonstate.edu

The data for this project is obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/somesnm/partynyc). The data is noise complaints from New Yearâ€™s eve (2016) from New York. The cylinders represent the number of calls and the color of the cylinders represent the time it took to close the ticket associated with the noise complaint.








The insights we get from this data are:
1: The areas that are considered wealthy have more celebrations
2: The celebrations which were too loud were shut down quickly (all long cylinders are blue).

This is a node project. The entire project is available at https://github.com/ednihs-yahska/VizProject
